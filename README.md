i have updated the code in java.
--------------------------------------------------
Updated information
--------------------------------------------------
1. Error Logging: Error logging is implemented using Java's built-in Logger class. Errors related to external processes, MQTT communication, volume adjustment, and UDP message sending are logged with appropriate error messages and stack traces.
2. Handling MQTT Disconnection: The code now includes a callback to handle MQTT disconnection (connectionLost). A warning message is logged when the connection to the MQTT broker is lost.
3. Synchronous Interaction: The volume adjustment and UDP message sending methods are now non-blocking. They use separate processes or threads to execute external commands, preventing delays that could affect MQTT message processing.
4. Logging Format: Log lines include timestamps, logging levels, and the name of the subsystem (Main). The logging format is consistent throughout the code.
5. Meaningful Names: Files, variables
